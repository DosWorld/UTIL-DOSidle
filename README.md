# dosidle
A program that causes cpu to halt while DOS is idling

These are source codes of several versions of doisdle. The source code was a result of program dissassembly as the original code was only partially available. Since I was not able to contact the original authors this seemed the only way to be able to find out program's logic.

If you are the author of the program and want the code removed, please leavea a message.

dosidle
  v 1.32 first known version, used to understand isr 2dh
  v 2.51 last known version, used to understand rest of the logic
  v 3.00 to be a cleaned up version of 2.51 logic
